      remediation:
          summary: Replace eval() with safer parsing helpers or refactor to remove dynamic execution.
          steps:
              - Prefer ast.literal_eval() for trusted literals.
              - Use json.loads() when decoding JSON payloads.
              - Refactor business logic to avoid executing arbitrary strings.
