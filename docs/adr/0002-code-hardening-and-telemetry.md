# ADR-0002: Sprint Focus on Code Hardening and Analyzer Telemetry

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-10-15
- **Deciders:** Core maintainers, Emperator automation lead
- **Consulted:** Platform engineering, Security reviewers
- **Tags:** Roadmap, Tooling

## Context

The previous delivery pass established the core CLI, formatter hardening, and documentation. Upcoming
work aims to: (1) harden the codebase by paying down tooling cruft such as platform-specific cleanup
scripts, and (2) design telemetry collection for analyzer runs to support historical insights and
caching.

## Options Considered

### 1. Continue ad-hoc maintenance

- **Pros:** Minimal planning overhead.
- **Cons:** Fails to address known cleanup tasks (Apple scripts, YAML drift) and leaves telemetry design
  undefined.

### 2. Formal sprint with explicit objectives (selected)

- **Pros:** Aligns contributors on deliverables, allows ADR tracking, and ties directly to Next Steps.
- **Cons:** Requires additional documentation and coordination.

### 3. Pause feature work until telemetry is complete

- **Pros:** Guarantees telemetry completeness before other changes.
- **Cons:** Blocks user-impacting hardening work without clear benefit.

## Decision

Run a focused sprint covering:

1. Removal of redundant Apple-specific cleanup automation and workflows.
2. Establishment of an ADR system with templates to track new governance decisions.
3. Definition of telemetry requirements for analyzer runs, including storage format, retention,
   privacy posture, and integration with the CLI.

## Consequences

- Reduces maintenance burden by eliminating unused scripts and GitHub workflows.
- Provides a single ADR log to evaluate future governance changes.
- Creates a backlog item for implementing telemetry capture once the design is approved.

## Implementation Notes

- Track sprint execution in `Next_Steps.md`, linking to the ADR IDs for transparency.
- Update documentation (governance, index) to reference the ADR log.
- Follow-up work will add telemetry capture code and persistence once requirements stabilise.

## Status Log

- 2025-10-15 â€” Accepted alongside ADR-0001 to steer the code-hardening sprint.
