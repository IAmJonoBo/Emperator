## Implementation Notes

This phased approach keeps risk low, builds trust through incremental wins, and ensures each capability ships with the necessary documentation, automation, and validation. Each phase builds on the previous, with clear success criteria and exit gates.

**Current Focus:** Sprint 4 (IR & Analysis Integration) â€“ detailed planning complete, implementation starting.

**Next Milestone:** Sprint 5 (Safety Envelope) â€“ comprehensive design documented, awaiting Sprint 4 completion.
