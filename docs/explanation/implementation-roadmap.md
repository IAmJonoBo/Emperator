## Phase 1: Python-focused slice

**Status:** ï¿½ 40% Complete (At Risk)\
**Timeline:** Sprint 1-3 (Completed) + Sprint 4 (In Planning)

**Completed (Sprint 1-3):**

âœ… **Contract Foundation:**

- Contract validation CLI with strict mode (`emperator contract validate`)
- CUE-based conventions support
- OpenAPI spec integration for API scaffolding
- Rego policy framework

âœ… **CLI & Developer Tools:**

- Comprehensive CLI with Typer (`emperator`)
- Scaffold commands (`scaffold audit`, `scaffold ensure`)
- Doctor diagnostics (`doctor env`)
- Analysis planning (`analysis plan`, `analysis inspect`)
- Analysis execution (`analysis run`) with static command scaffolding
- Rich progress reporting and telemetry primitives

âœ… **Telemetry Infrastructure:**

- JSONL-backed telemetry store
- Fingerprinting for analysis runs
- Severity filtering and metadata capture
- Atomic writes with corruption handling

âœ… **Quality Infrastructure:**

- 100% test coverage (118 tests passing)
- Ruff `ALL` lint configuration
- Mypy type checking
- Pre-commit hooks and CI integration
- SARIF output for security findings

**Reality Check (Sprint 4 â€“ IR & Analysis Integration):**

ï¿½ **IR Construction (Unstarted):**

- Tree-sitter parser, incremental cache, symbol extraction, and pruning commands remain unimplemented despite ADR-0004.
- No `src/emperator/ir/` package or serialization layer exists; telemetry currently lacks IR metrics.
- Packaging omits Tree-sitter grammars, MessagePack/zstd, and build hooks, so prerequisites are missing.

ï¿½ **Analysis Integration (Unstarted):**

- `plan_tool_invocations` still emits static Semgrep/CodeQL commands with no contract-aware rule generation.
- Sprint 4 tasks for Semgrep rule packs, CodeQL lifecycle, findings correlation, and remediation guidance remain unchecked.
- Telemetry captures raw executions but lacks rule pack provenance or correlation outputs.

- [Sprint 4 Playbook Tasks](../../Next_Steps.md#sprint-4--ir--analysis-integration)

## Phase 2: Developer feedback loop

**Status:** âšª Planned (Blocked by Phase 1 gaps)\
**Timeline:** Sprint 5 (Planned) + Sprint 6 (Future)

**Sprint 5 â€“ Automated Fix & Safety Envelope (Planned, Blocked):**

ï¿½ **Fix Engine Foundation:**

- LibCST/OpenRewrite transformers, risk classifier, and fix registry have not begun; repository currently lacks fix-related modules.
- ADR-0005â€™s design remains theoretical until IR + analyzer correlation supply inputs for tiering.

ï¿½ **Safety Validation & Rollback:**

- Validation orchestrator, test selection, rollback manager, and approval workflows are absent.
- CLI `fix` commands only replay environment remediations; no automated fix pipeline exists.

ï¿½ **Property-Based Testing:**

- Hypothesis-based idempotence suites and telemetry upgrades are pending future work.

**Sprint 6 â€“ Production Hardening (Future):**

âšª Pilot with real teams to gather usability data
âšª Measure runtime and identify noisy rules
âšª Harden pre-commit and CI integrations
âšª SARIF uploads and provenance artifact capture
âšª Expand documentation based on pilot feedback
âšª Waiver workflows and troubleshooting guides

## Integrated Remediation Plan

To realign the Contract â†’ IR â†’ Execution architecture with reality, the roadmap now tracks the following remediation program:

### 1. Ship the IR builder foundation (Sprint 4 Week 1 focus)

- Introduce Tree-sitter and serialization dependencies (MessagePack/zstd) in `pyproject.toml`, wire grammar build steps, and provision the required tooling in `scripts/setup-tooling.sh`.
- Scaffold `src/emperator/ir/` with `IRBuilder`, cache manager, and symbol extractor per ADR-0004, emitting telemetry for parse metrics.
- Expose CLI entry points (`emperator ir parse`, `emperator ir cache prune`) and back them with â‰¥95% test coverage plus documentation (`docs/reference/ir-format.md`, usage how-to).

### 2. Connect the contract to analyzers and correlation (Sprint 4 Weeks 2-4)

- Build the Semgrep rule generator that translates CUE/Rego metadata into rule packs under `contract/generated/semgrep/` and integrate it into `analysis plan/run`.
- Implement a CodeQL database manager with lifecycle commands, curated query packs under `rules/codeql/`, and documented workflows.
- Add a findings correlation engine that maps analyzer output back to contract rules, extracts remediation guidance, and reuses the IR cache for language awareness.

### 3. Harden telemetry, dependencies, and performance baselines

- Extend telemetry stores to capture IR parse metrics, rule-generation provenance, analyzer severity summaries, and benchmark results per ADR-0003.
- Introduce CI jobs for IR cache validation, Semgrep/CodeQL smoke tests, and performance regression thresholds (â‰¤5s/1000 files initial parse, â‰¤500ms incremental updates).
- Update packaging scripts and developer bootstrap paths so analyzer and parser toolchains install consistently across environments.

### 4. Deliver the safety envelope and fix engine (Sprint 5 end-to-end)

- Add LibCST-based transformer infrastructure, risk-tier classifier, validation orchestrator, and rollback strategies matching ADR-0005â€™s multi-layer model.
- Integrate OpenRewrite for JVM lanes, property-based tests (Hypothesis) for fix idempotence, and provenance-rich telemetry events.
- Replace the current `fix` CLI placeholder with the new validation/apply pipeline, ensuring severity gating, approval workflows, and rollback controls.

## Phase 3: Polyglot expansion
