# Emperator Technical Brief

Emperator turns software standards into an executable contract that continuously audits, fixes, and scaffolds code across polyglot projects. This brief follows the Diátaxis framework so you can ramp up quickly, apply the platform in day-to-day workflows, understand the system internals, and cite precise specifications when needed.

- **Onboard fast:** Start with the tutorial to install the CLI, compile your first contract, and experience the safety loop locally before involving CI.
- **Operationalize standards:** Use the how-to guides for contract authoring, pipeline integration, and responsible AI-assisted refactors.
- **Understand the why:** The explanation deep dive maps the Contract→IR→Action pipeline, safety envelope, and extensibility points.
- **Reference details:** Consult the reference section for rule schemas, toolchain support matrices, SBOM and audit artifacts, and Copilot prompt packs.
- **Track decisions:** Review the Architecture Decision Records under `docs/adr/` for the rationale behind strategic changes and sprint scopes.

> **Copilot tip:** Add `docs/includes/copilot-prompts.md` to your prompt library so the assistant can surface project-aware scaffolds and review checklists while you work.
