# Emperator Documentation

Welcome to the Emperator developer documentation. Use MkDocs or another static site generator to publish guidance derived from these sources.

## Getting Started

1. Install project dependencies as described in the root `README.md`.
2. Run `mkdocs serve` (after configuring `mkdocs.yml`) to preview changes locally.
3. Contribute docs using concise sections and cross-link to contract artifacts.
