# Developer Tooling

Command-line helpers, codemods, and scripts that support Emperator development live here. Split utilities by usage context to keep CI-friendly code isolated.

- `dev/` — Local-only tools (seed data, demos, experiments).
- `ci/` — Deterministic scripts invoked during automation.
