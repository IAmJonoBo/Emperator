# Emperator: Frontier-Grade Development Orchestration Brief

## Objectives & Novelty of Emperator

**Emperator’s Mission:**  
Emperator is a platform-agnostic standards enforcement and orchestration tool designed to elevate software projects to frontier-grade quality. It treats “how we build” as an executable Project Contract—a single source of truth defining code standards, API schemas, dependency rules, security policies, and more. Emperator compiles this contract into checks, fixes, scaffolds, and gates that apply across multiple languages and ecosystems. The goal is to empower developers (and AI copilots) in any environment—from air-gapped enterprise networks to cloud CI/CD—to consistently produce A-grade, secure, and maintainable code without cumbersome manual processes.

**What’s New:**  
Emperator’s approach moves beyond a “tool soup” of disconnected linters and scripts by unifying them under one Contract→IR→Action pipeline. The novelty lies in:

- **Contract-Compiled Development:**  
  A versioned, declarative Project Contract (leveraging open standards like OpenAPI, CUE, Rego) that is executable. When the contract’s rules change, Emperator automatically re-compiles them into updated checks and migrations across the codebase. This prevents the usual drift between documentation and implementation.

- **Single Polyglot IR:**  
  Emperator builds one universal code intermediate representation (IR) for your project, combining fast concrete syntax trees from Tree-sitter with semantic graphs and dataflow from CodeQL, plus pattern rules from Semgrep. This unified view allows cross-cutting queries (“find all calls violating the layering policy”) across languages—a capability prior tools provided only in silos.

- **Deterministic Yet Safe Automation:**  
  Emperator doesn’t just flag issues—it can fix and upgrade code safely. It applies proven codemod engines (like LibCST for Python and OpenRewrite for JVM) for auto-refactoring, but only after rigorous validation (static analysis checks, optional property-based tests) in a “safety envelope.” High-risk changes are proposed as suggestions (with inline diffs) rather than applied blindly. This blends automation with human oversight, avoiding the “too much magic” problem.

**Summary:**  
Emperator aims to raise the bar of software quality by making codebase standards enforceable and evolvable through automation. It targets everyone from solo maintainers to large teams, giving them “superpowers” to achieve top-tier code health and security without onerous effort. The following sections detail the system’s architecture and components, guided by expert perspectives in software architecture, static analysis, DevSecOps, developer experience, security engineering, AI integration, and governance.

> _Influence note: The vision for Emperator is ambitious but grounded in existing technologies. We will cite industry standards and successful OSS tools to justify each design choice, and we’ll flag where uncertainty or complexity remains._

## Architecture & System Design (Chief Software Architect)

**Overall Design:**  
Emperator’s architecture follows a simple high-level flow—Contract → IR → Action Engines—all under a safety pipeline. It is composed of modular components that align with the C4 model’s layers: a Contract Layer (inputs), an IR/Analysis Layer (internal representation of code), and an Execution Layer (tools that check or modify code), orchestrated by a central CLI/LSP service. The diagram below illustrates this flow:

  F -->|Pass| G[Changes Applied<br/>+ Provenance logged]
  F -->|Fail| I[Abort fixes<br/>(report to developer)]
  G --> H
```

> **Figure: Emperator pipeline overview.**  
> The Project Contract is compiled into a unified IR of the code. Check engines run queries and pattern rules on this IR to detect deviations from the contract. If violations are found, the Safety Gate decides how to handle them: some issues trigger automatic fixes via codemod engines, followed by formatting; others are surfaced as diff proposals for developer review. All changes or findings loop back into re-checking (and optional tests) to ensure nothing breaks contract rules. The process yields either a clean result or a set of diffs for the developer, and always logs what rules were enforced for audit. This loop can run continuously (in an editor or pre-commit) and in CI to prevent regressions.

### Contract Layer

The Project Contract is a declarative, versioned collection of rules and standards. Rather than inventing a new DSL, Emperator adopts proven open standards for each type of rule, ensuring portability and clarity. For example:

- **API schemas** are written in OpenAPI (for REST/HTTP) or GraphQL SDL.
- **Configuration and naming conventions** in CUE (open-source data constraint language).
- **Security/business policies** in OPA Rego (Open Policy Agent’s policy language).

Using these standards means the contract is itself testable and can be independently reviewed or reused. OpenAPI provides a language-agnostic way to describe HTTP APIs, so both humans and tools can understand a service’s capabilities. CUE allows succinctly expressing config schemas and relationships with powerful constraint logic, and OPA/Rego provides a unified policy engine for enforcing rules ("policy as code") across the stack. By storing the contract in a directory (e.g. `contract/`) with subfiles like `api/openapi.yaml`, `policy/rules.rego`, `conventions.cue`, and `generators/` templates, the project’s standards become a first-class, version-controlled artifact rather than tribal knowledge.

### Universal Code IR

Emperator builds an Intermediate Representation (IR) that abstracts the codebase in a language-agnostic graph. This is key to enforcing rules uniformly across a polyglot project. The IR construction has multiple layers:

- **Parsing with Tree-sitter:**  
  Tree-sitter is used to parse source files of many languages into Concrete Syntax Trees (CSTs) rapidly and incrementally. It supports parsing on every keystroke with error tolerance, which means Emperator’s IR can update near-real-time as code changes. Tree-sitter’s parser runtime is in C and can be embedded anywhere, ensuring Emperator’s core remains dependency-free and fast. Dozens of language grammars are available (C, C++, Python, Go, Java, JavaScript, etc.)—providing generality.

- **Semantic Enrichment with CodeQL:**  
  For deeper understanding, Emperator generates a CodeQL database of the code (for supported languages). CodeQL treats code as queryable data: it creates a relational representation of program elements (classes, functions, call graphs, data flows) and allows writing queries in a Datalog-like language to find patterns. By querying the IR rather than raw code, Emperator can ask complex questions like "which functions access the database layer" or "where is type X used across modules." CodeQL’s approach (used in GitHub’s security scanning) is powerful: you first generate a database from the code, then run queries to identify issues. It supports multiple languages (C/C++, C#, Go, Java/Kotlin, JS/TS, Python, Ruby, etc.), though not all (e.g. PHP isn’t supported by CodeQL as of 2025, which Emperator must handle via other means). The CodeQL integration enables semantic checks and enforcement of architectural constraints that go beyond regex or AST patterns—for example, ensuring no forbidden function call is reachable from certain modules, by analyzing the call graph.

- **Pattern Rules with Semgrep:**  
  Emperator integrates Semgrep to leverage its extensive rulesets and multi-language pattern matching. Semgrep is a fast, open-source static analysis tool that finds code snippets matching abstract patterns (with a syntax resembling the source code). It covers 30+ languages and can run in milliseconds on code diffs or files. Emperator uses Semgrep in two ways:
  1. To enforce coding conventions and simple safety rules as defined in the Contract (e.g. naming conventions, banned APIs) by compiling contract guidelines into Semgrep rules.
  2. To run vetted security rules (like those from OWASP checks or the Semgrep community rule library) as part of its check phase.

Because Semgrep patterns "look like code" and don’t require writing complex AST queries, it’s easy to extend Emperator with new checks—even developers can add custom rules in the contract. For instance, if the contract says "no direct SQL strings, must use parameterized queries," Emperator can include a Semgrep rule searching for `execute("SELECT ...")` patterns. Semgrep’s appeal is speed and simplicity (no heavy parse or compile needed), making it ideal for pre-commit and CI quick scans.

(Evidence: Semgrep’s official description highlights it enforces secure guardrails and coding standards, and can run in IDEs, pre-commit, and CI.)

Together, these layers form a unified IR: Tree-sitter provides a lossless syntax tree for each file, augmented with symbols and cross-references from CodeQL, plus pattern-matching hooks from Semgrep. Emperator maintains this IR in memory (or a local cache) and updates it incrementally as code changes, avoiding full re-analysis on every run. This incremental approach, inspired by modern IDEs and static analysis tools, ensures fast feedback—after initial indexing, subsequent Emperator runs (such as in daemon mode) are highly responsive, which is essential for developer experience.

### Action Engines

With the IR available, Emperator “compiles” the Project Contract into actionable tasks. The main action types are:

- **Check:**  
  Emperator enforces contract rules by running Semgrep patterns, CodeQL queries, and contract validators against the IR. For example, if the contract specifies that files in `controllers/` must use lower_snake_case, Emperator generates or uses a Semgrep rule to check filenames. If an OpenAPI spec defines a POST `/items` endpoint with a `price: number` field, Emperator checks that the handler’s data model matches. Rego policies are evaluated via OPA integration to catch higher-level logic or config violations. Findings are tagged by severity and fixability. Security issues—such as SQL injection, use of `eval`, or hardcoded credentials—are flagged using CodeQL’s security queries and Semgrep’s rulesets. Each key check is evidence-gated, backed by official standards (e.g., OWASP) and proven static rules, minimizing false positives.

- **Fix (Auto-Remediation):**  
  For fixable violations, Emperator applies codemods using language-specific transformation engines:

  - _Python:_ Uses LibCST to parse and transform code while preserving formatting and comments. For example, it can replace `%`-style string formatting with f-strings, ensuring minimal diffs.
  - _JVM/Java:_ Integrates OpenRewrite, which provides pre-built recipes for common refactors (e.g., migrating deprecated APIs). OpenRewrite supports Java, YAML, XML, Kotlin, and more, enabling mass refactoring with reproducibility.
  - _Other Languages:_ For JavaScript/TypeScript, Emperator may use OpenRewrite’s JS module or specialized AST/refactor libraries. For C/C++, tools like Clang Tidy can be integrated. Emperator’s plugin API allows swapping in appropriate codemod engines per language.

  After fixes, Emperator re-checks the code against the contract to ensure no new issues were introduced. If a fix causes a new violation, it is rolled back and flagged for manual review, following a “first, do no harm” principle.

- **Scaffold & Generate:**  
  Emperator can generate boilerplate or migration scaffolding based on the contract. For example, if a new API endpoint is added to the OpenAPI spec, Emperator can scaffold a handler function, data model, or test skeleton using templates from `contract/generators/`. Generation actions are controlled—they do not overwrite existing code without permission and all created files are logged for review.

- **Format:**  
  After fixes or generation, Emperator runs language-native formatters for consistency:
  - _Python:_ Ruff (fast linter/formatter), Black for additional formatting.
  - _JavaScript:_ Prettier or ESLint.
  - _Go:_ gofmt.
  - _C/C++:_ clang-format.
    Formatting ensures code style remains clean and standardized, leveraging trusted community tools.

#### Plugin & Module Boundaries

Emperator is architected as a core orchestrator with plugin interfaces for languages and tool integrations. The core manages contract loading, analysis scheduling, fix coordination, and safety checks. Language-specific parsing, linting, and codemods are encapsulated in plugins. Adding support for a new language involves integrating its Tree-sitter grammar, CodeQL database (if available), Semgrep patterns, and formatters. This modular design ensures scalability and maintainability.

#### Performance Considerations

To ensure smooth operation:

- **Incremental Analysis Daemon:**  
  Emperator can run as a background daemon, watching the filesystem or integrating with IDEs via LSP. Tree-sitter re-parses only edited parts efficiently; CodeQL databases can be updated incrementally; Semgrep runs per file or diff. Caching the IR enables near-instant feedback.

- **Batch and Async Execution:**  
  In CI, analyses are batched and run in parallel to utilize multiple cores. Quick checks can fail fast, while longer checks run in the background. The CLI supports modes like `emperor check --fast` for interactive use and `--full` for CI.

- **Memory Management:**  
  For large codebases, Emperator loads analyses on demand—e.g., running specific CodeQL queries via CLI rather than loading the entire database in memory. Initial implementations target moderately sized projects, with documented constraints.

**C4 Model Mapping:**

- _Level 1 (Context):_ Emperator integrates with VCS, IDE, CI, and outputs code changes or reports.
- _Level 2 (Containers):_ Main container is a CLI/LSP service, optionally with a local cache.
- _Level 3 (Components):_ Includes contract loader, IR builder, check/fix engine coordinators, safety manager, and output reporter.
- _Level 4 (Code):_ Anticipated modules include `parser_service.py`, `rule_engine.py`, `codemod_runner.py`, each testable in isolation.

## Static Analysis & Code Transformation (Static Analysis Engineer)

From a static analysis and program transformation perspective, Emperator fuses compiler-like techniques with software engineering rules to ensure automated changes are correct and analyses are comprehensive. This section details the implementation of the polyglot IR, rule checking, and code rewriting, emphasizing soundness and reliability.

### Building the Polyglot IR

Emperator leverages three core technologies for program analysis:

- **Tree-sitter**: Provides Concrete Syntax Trees (CST) for exact source information, including tokens, structure, and comments. It offers lossless parsing for each file and supports bindings in Python, Go, Rust, and more.
- **CodeQL**: Supplies a logical code model, enabling queries about classes, function calls, and data flow. CodeQL constructs a relational database of the code, allowing complex pattern detection using its QL language.
- **Semgrep**: Delivers pattern matching on code, abstracting details with wildcards and simple syntax. Semgrep excels at stylistic and localized patterns, making it ideal for enforcing coding conventions and security rules.

**Workflow:**

1. **Parse Files**: Use Tree-sitter to generate CSTs for all source files, attaching metadata such as symbol IDs and type information.
2. **Generate CodeQL Database**: For supported languages, create a CodeQL database using the CLI (e.g., `codeql database create dbdir --language=python --source-root=.`). Load custom and standard queries from the contract.
3. **Load Semgrep Rules**: Translate contract rules into Semgrep YAML syntax or import existing rules. Include security and framework-specific patterns as needed.

The CST nodes are annotated with findings from CodeQL and Semgrep. For example, Semgrep may flag a function name violating naming conventions, while CodeQL can identify forbidden function calls. Emperator maintains an internal map of code locations to contract violations and possible fixes, similar to how compilers record errors and warnings.

### Rule Triangulation

Emperator adopts an evidence-gated protocol by triangulating analyses for key rules:

- **Example**: For a security rule like "No direct SQL string concatenation":
  - Semgrep pattern detects direct concatenation.
  - CodeQL query confirms with data flow analysis.
- **Action**: Auto-fix or fail CI only if analyses agree; disagreements are marked for human review. Findings are graded by confidence (e.g., `[High] Potential SQL injection in foo.py:12`), providing transparency for developers.

### Advanced Analysis: AST, CFG, SSA

While most contract rules do not require full dataflow or SSA analysis, Emperator’s design allows for deeper integration if needed. CodeQL handles control flow graphs and dataflow for supported languages. For specialized domains (e.g., MISRA C compliance), Emperator can integrate external static analyzers as plugins, though initial scope focuses on leveraging existing tools.

### Program Transformation Guarantees

To ensure safe code modifications, Emperator employs several strategies:

- **Localized, Verified Codemods**: Uses conservative frameworks like LibCST, enabling verification by running original tests on transformed code. Transformations are based on well-understood patterns (e.g., converting `%`-style formatting to f-strings).
- **Equivalence and Idempotence**: After applying codemods, Emperator re-runs the same rules to confirm no further changes are needed, ensuring idempotence and catching partial application issues.
- **Formal Methods (Future Work)**: For high-assurance contexts, formal equivalence checking (e.g., using SMT solvers like Z3) may be considered for pure functions and critical refactors. Currently, Emperator relies on testing to validate correctness.

---

By combining multiple static analysis engines and conservative transformation frameworks, Emperator achieves high coverage and safe automation, reducing false positives and ensuring code integrity throughout the enforcement process.

### Example Codemod Workflow

Let’s walk through a concrete example to illustrate static analysis + codemod:

- **Rule:** Controller layer must not directly call the DB layer; must call through Service layer (a typical layering rule).
- **Contract:** Expressed in Rego, e.g.:

```rego
  violation[loc] {
    caller.packages[layer="controller"]
    callee.packages[layer="db"]
  }
```

This detects forbidden calls.

- **Check:** Emperator could implement this via a CodeQL query to find any function in the controller package calling a function in the db package not via an intermediate. The query runs and returns a set of violating call pairs.
- **Remediation:** Suppose it finds 3 violations. For each:
  - Full automation may not be possible (moving code affects architecture).
  - Emperator can assist by generating an intermediate function in the service layer or flagging the issue.
  - For risky changes, Emperator presents a scaffold suggestion: create a new function in Service that wraps the DB call, and update the Controller to call that. This can be partially automated if types are clear.
  - Alternatively, Emperator can gate this: fail CI until the developer moves the call, but provide a guided fix (e.g., interactive mode: “I see controller X calling db Y. Do you want me to create a service method for it? (y/n)”).
  - Emperator escalates from fully automatic (trivial fixes) to interactive suggestion for bigger changes.

### Pattern Matching vs AST Rewriting

- Simple fixes (e.g., add missing newline at EOF) can use regex or AST patterns (Semgrep autofix templates).
- Complex refactorings (e.g., migrating framework usage) require deeper AST understanding and possibly flow/context info, which codemod libraries handle better.
- Emperator uses the right tool for the job: structured AST replacement for complex changes, simple patterns for trivial ones.

### Meta-Programming and Self-Application

- Emperator’s Contract is code that can generate code.
- Contract compilation itself is tested; e.g., if a contract update provides a wrong Semgrep pattern, Emperator should catch it (by testing the rule on sample code or via dry-run).
- Contract authors validate new rules in a staging area.
- `emperor dry-run` prints what would change without modifying code, allowing review of a new rule’s impact.

---

**Summary:**  
From the static analysis engineer’s perspective, Emperator combines multiple analysis techniques for high coverage and uses proven transformation frameworks to modify code safely. Each check and fix is evidence-backed (by standards or prior tools). Uncertainties (aliasing, dynamic typing) are mitigated by secondary checks or human review when confidence is low. This approach aligns with state-of-the-art research: blending static analysis with automated repair can significantly improve code quality. For example, recent studies show LLMs guided by static analysis reduce security issues and improve code quality by 3–5× versus unguided code—Emperator applies a similar “analyze then fix” loop.

- Quick actions allow autofixes directly from the editor.
- Snippets and scaffolding can be offered based on contract definitions.

---

## Minimal Config & Adoption

- Emperator is mostly config-free aside from the contract.
- Easy to install and run: `emperor apply`.
- Integrates with existing formats (OpenAPI, CUE, etc.).
- Platform-agnostic: works on Linux, macOS, Windows, and with any VCS or editor supporting LSP.

---

## Developer Experience & Feedback

- Outputs include links or rationales for each rule, educating developers.
- Fast turnaround (aim for sub-5 seconds on small commits).
- Customizable enforcement profiles (pedantic vs lenient).
- Clear communication: contract rules are explicit and collaborative.

---

## CLI & CI Example

GitHub Actions snippet:

```yaml
- name: Run Emperator (Standards Enforcement)
  run: |
    emperor apply --format=sarif --out=emperor.sarif || true
- name: Upload Emperator Results
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
  with:
    sarif_file: emperor.sarif
```

Alternatively, strict enforcement:

```yaml
- run: emperor apply --strict
```

---

## Security Engineering & Safe Automation

- Emperator enforces security best practices (OWASP Top 10, CWE) via CodeQL and Semgrep.
- Detects vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, deprecated functions, and unsafe patterns.
- Categorizes fixes by risk tier:
  - **Tier 0:** Pure formatting/style (auto-apply)
  - **Tier 1:** Localized refactors (auto-apply, test-verified)
  - **Tier 2:** Complex refactors (suggestion only)
  - **Tier 3:** Large changes (manual review)
- All changes are traceable and reversible (supports `emperor undo`).

---

## Safety Envelope

- Automated fixes are validated by static analysis and tests.
- Rollbacks and atomic commits ensure code integrity.
- Threat modeling and robust upstream tools mitigate risks.
- LLM-generated suggestions are always validated before application.

---

**In summary:**  
Emperator integrates seamlessly into developer workflows, automates standards enforcement, educates users, and maintains a rigorous safety model. Its outputs are clear, actionable, and backed by authoritative sources, making it a trusted assistant for code quality and security.

### Air-Gapped Operation

Emperator is designed to run fully offline. All rule packs (e.g., Semgrep rules) can be vendored or cached locally, and dependencies like CodeQL CLI are installed on-premises. Organizations with no internet access on CI can still use Emperator by distributing dependencies internally. Emperator itself can be provided via an offline installer or a mirrored PyPI package.

### Hardening Example

**Scenario:**  
A function `def get_user(input): return eval(input)` is detected. The contract bans `eval`.

- **Check phase:** Semgrep flags the usage.
- **Fix phase:** Emperator suggests replacing `eval` with `ast.literal_eval` if context allows, or recommends refactoring. Since `literal_eval` only covers a subset, Emperator outputs a suggestion rather than auto-fixing, blocking CI until addressed.
- **Safety:** Automation defers to human judgment for risky changes, ensuring no half-baked fixes are applied.

**Another example:**  
If Emperator auto-replaces a deprecated function but the new function behaves differently, tests are run post-change. If a test fails, Emperator reverts the change and issues a warning, preserving code integrity.

### Continuous Security Updates

Emperator’s contract and rule packs can be updated as new vulnerabilities or standards emerge. Security teams can enforce new rules quickly by updating the contract, ensuring rapid propagation of expertise and reducing manual effort.

### Security Impact

Emperator is expected to significantly reduce security bugs and improve code robustness. Many fixes are automated or clearly guided, allowing security engineers to focus on architectural concerns while Emperator handles routine enforcement.

### AI Integration & Automated Refactoring

**Role of AI:**  
Emperator uses rule-based static analysis and codemods for most tasks. For complex or context-dependent issues, optional AI/LLM integration provides:

- Intelligent refactor suggestions
- Code generation from specs
- Ranking and refinement of multiple fixes
- Natural language explanations of flagged issues

**Local AI Models:**  
Emperator favors local, open-source LLMs (e.g., Code Llama, StarCoder) for privacy and offline use. Organizations can plug in their own fine-tuned models.

**Propose-Rank-Validate Loop:**

1. **Propose:** LLM suggests fixes for issues lacking deterministic solutions.
2. **Rank:** Emperator checks each candidate against contract rules and selects the safest.
3. **Validate:** All AI-generated changes are statically analyzed and tested before application; non-trivial changes require human approval.

**Use Cases:**

- Complex deprecation upgrades
- Code generation from contract specs
- Documentation and explanation generation

**Privacy & Governance:**  
AI suggestions are clearly marked, traceable, and can be disabled. Only models with appropriate licensing are integrated.

**Execution Constraints:**  
AI-assisted refactoring is opt-in, not run on every commit. Developers can trigger AI suggestions via CLI or as part of scheduled jobs.

**Validation:**  
All AI outputs are validated by Emperator’s static analysis and test gates. Invalid or insecure suggestions are discarded.

**Continuous Learning:**  
Organizations may fine-tune models on their own code patterns for tailored assistance, though this is optional and subject to privacy controls.

**Documentation Generation:**  
AI can draft docstrings or comments when required by contract, subject to developer review.

**Case Study:**  
For large upgrades (e.g., Python 2 to 3), AI can suggest migration patches for patterns not easily handled by codemods.

**Risk Mitigation:**  
Multi-layered validation and clear marking of AI-generated code ensure safety. Organizations can disable AI features if desired.

### Compliance & Governance

Emperator enforces organizational standards, regulatory requirements, and supports controlled change management.

**Versioned Rule Sets:**  
The Project Contract is versioned and tracked in VCS. Every change is reviewable and traceable, with contract versions referenced in code changes and commit messages.

**Audit Trail & Provenance:**  
Emperator logs every issue, fix, and rule reference. Outputs can be machine-readable (JSON/SARIF) and include provenance metadata (e.g., in-toto attestations, SLSA provenance).

**Deprecation & Migration Governance:**  
Deprecations are declared in the contract, with staged enforcement and migration recipes. Audit logs show when and how migrations occurred.

**Policy & Regulatory Compliance:**  
Emperator encodes standards like MISRA C, CERT Secure Coding, HIPAA, etc., in the contract. Unified reporting simplifies audits and compliance evidence.

**Separation of Duties:**  
Governance teams maintain the contract; developers implement via Emperator. Changes to the contract are reviewable and flow automatically to code enforcement.

**Exemptions & Risk Acceptance:**  
Waivers require justification and are tracked. Emperator can report all active exemptions for risk management.

**SBOM & License Compliance:**  
Emperator generates SBOMs (CycloneDX/SPDX) and checks license compliance per contract rules (e.g., flagging GPL-3.0 dependencies).

**Change Control:**  
Emperator and contract updates are versioned and subject to review. Backward compatibility and release notes ensure controlled evolution.

### Provenance Summary

- **Data:** Approach based on official specs and industry standards (Tree-sitter, CodeQL, Semgrep, OpenRewrite, OpenAPI, OPA, SLSA).
- **Methods:** Combines parse trees, semantic graphs, pattern matching, and transformation engines, validated by prior art and documentation.
- **Key Results:** Unified pipeline improves code quality, security, and consistency. OSS components provide speed and coverage.
- **Uncertainty:** Some languages may elude full static analysis; AI suggestions vary in quality. Risks are mitigated by phased rollout and human review.
- **Safer Alternative:** Emperator can run in check-only mode, flagging violations and auto-formatting, but not auto-fixing complex issues without approval. Incremental adoption builds trust and assurance.

---

By balancing ambition with caution and leveraging state-of-the-art tools, Emperator provides a unified, evidence-gated solution for code standardization, security, and compliance. Its implementation roadmap starts with Python and core features, expanding incrementally to a polyglot, AI-augmented, and compliance-friendly system.

### Implementation Roadmap & Demo Plan

**Initial Target (6–8 weeks):**

1. **Contract Parsing:** Minimal Project Contract (CUE for naming/layer policy, Rego for security, OpenAPI for endpoints)

2. **IR Build (Python):** Tree-sitter parsing, Semgrep integration, CodeQL database (simulated if needed)

3. **Check Phase:** Detect naming, layer, and security violations via AST/Semgrep

4. **Fix Phase:** Auto-fix naming (LibCST), formatting (Ruff/Black), scaffold endpoint stubs

5. **Safety Pipeline:** Run property-based or unit tests post-fix

6. **CLI & Output:** Print diffs, set up pre-commit hook

7. **LSP Integration (basic):** Simulate diagnostics in VSCode or via problems matcher

8. **Documentation & Example:** Example repo with known issues, before/after demo

**Beyond 8 weeks:**

- Expand language support (Java, JavaScript, etc.)
- Increase rule coverage (more Semgrep/CodeQL rules)
- Full LSP integration
- Optional AI assistance for complex fixes
- Richer reporting (HTML summaries, code review comments)

Each phase is evidence-driven and validated on sample projects, ensuring safety and reliability.

---

By following this plan, Emperator will incrementally deliver a robust, unified tool for code quality, security, and compliance, starting with Python and expanding to broader ecosystems.
