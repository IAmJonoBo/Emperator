# Emperator Delivery Plan

## Context

- **Mission alignment:** Emperator operationalises a Project Contract so standards, policies, and scaffolds stay executable across languages and stacks, as outlined in `Emperator_Master.md`.
- **Architecture touchpoints:** Delivery must cover the Contract → IR → Action pipeline, ensuring contract assets (`contract/`), analysis rules (`rules/`), orchestration code (`src/emperator`), and docs evolve together.
- **Stakeholder outcomes:** Provide automation that keeps teams in compliance, accelerates development, and supplies audit-ready evidence for governance and security partners.

## Strategic Goals

1. **Executable Contract** – Author and validate the Project Contract so conventions, APIs, and policies are machine-enforceable.
2. **Deterministic Automation** – Build the core CLI, IR, and action engines that turn contract deltas into checks, fixes, and scaffolds.
3. **Safety Envelope** – Guarantee every automated change runs through tests, type-checks, security scans, and human review gates where required.
4. **Developer Experience** – Deliver intuitive workflows, documentation, and guardrails that make Emperator the fastest path to compliant code.
5. **Operational Readiness** – Establish observability, release, and governance practices to support production adoption and continuous improvement.

## Guiding Principles & Quality Conventions

- **Definition of Ready:** Backlog items specify contract inputs, IR dependencies, acceptance tests, security requirements, and rollback strategy.
- **Definition of Done:**
  - Tests: `pytest --cov=emperator --cov-report=term-missing` with ≥90% coverage and no collection errors.
  - Lint/Format: `ruff check --no-fix .`, `ruff format --check .`, `eslint`/`biome` for JS assets.
  - Types: `mypy src` with zero errors (missing stubs resolved via typeshed packages).
  - Security: `bandit -r src`, Semgrep/CodeQL packs defined in `rules/`.
  - Build: `python -m build` clean of warnings, including SPDX compliance.
  - Docs & Contract: Updated references in `docs/`, `contract/`, `directory_structure.md`, and changelog entries when user-visible.
- **Conventions Enforcement:** CUE schemas in `contract/conventions/` and policy rules gate directory structure, naming, and resource allocation; these must be compiled and executed in CI before merges.
- **Evidence Capture:** Every sprint exits with artifacts: coverage reports, SBOM, contract diffs, and remediation logs stored in `docs/` or release notes.

## Workstreams

1. **Contract Authoring & Governance** – Curate API schemas, policies, and conventions; define change control and review cadence with stakeholders.
2. **Analysis & Automation Platform** – Implement IR builders, rule execution, codemod runners, and CLI interfaces.
3. **Tooling & Developer Experience** – Deliver scaffolding templates, IDE/CI integrations, and onboarding materials (tutorials, CLI docs).
4. **Operational Excellence** – Build observability, packaging, release management, and security posture (supply-chain, SBOM, secrets hygiene).
5. **Adoption & Feedback Loop** – Pilot with early teams, gather metrics, iterate on contract scope, and expand language/tool coverage.

## Phase Roadmap

### Phase 0 – Discovery & Alignment

- **Objectives:** Confirm scope, assemble stakeholders, baseline current tooling, and validate assumptions about supported stacks.
- **Key Activities:** Requirement workshops, audit existing standards, prioritise contract modules, document risks.
- **Deliverables:** Stakeholder map, initial risk register, prioritised backlog, baseline metrics for quality gates.
- **Exit Criteria:** Agreement on MVP contract scope; baseline test/lint/type/security/build runs recorded; governance model ratified.

### Phase 1 – Contract Foundation

- **Objectives:** Create executable Project Contract skeleton covering APIs, policies, and conventions.
- **Key Activities:** Draft OpenAPI/GraphQL specs, codify conventions in CUE, scaffold Rego policies, and seed generators.
- **Deliverables:** Versioned contract repo section with validation scripts and docs describing authoring workflow.
- **Exit Criteria:** Contract validation CLI passes; conventions enforced on sample code; review sign-off from security and architecture leads.

### Phase 2 – Core Platform Bootstrapping

- **Objectives:** Implement CLI flows (scaffold, check, fix, doctor) and integrate baseline analyzers.
- **Key Activities:** Build IR ingestion, integrate Tree-sitter/Semgrep/CodeQL hooks, ensure CLI commands orchestrate checks and fixes.
- **Deliverables:** Working CLI with smoke tests, automated scaffolding templates, IR schema docs, initial Semgrep/CodeQL packs.
- **Exit Criteria:** Automated quality gates green on sample projects; codemod dry-run pipeline verified; CLI docs published in `docs/cli.md`.

### Phase 3 – Safety Envelope & Automation Confidence

- **Objectives:** Harden automated fixes, add regression tests, expand coverage metrics, and institute approval workflows.
- **Key Activities:** Implement rollback logic, add property/contract tests, integrate coverage reporting, build gating dashboards.
- **Deliverables:** Safety matrix, regression suite, coverage thresholds enforced in CI, documented rollback playbooks.
- **Exit Criteria:** Automated fixes pass double-run validation; coverage ≥ target; audit trail for each fix; CI blocks merges on violations.

### Phase 4 – Ecosystem Integration & DX Enhancements

- **Objectives:** Ship IDE/CI integrations, doc site, onboarding flows, and cross-language support expansions.
- **Key Activities:** Build VS Code tasks, GitHub app hooks, interactive tutorials, cross-language contract templates.
- **Deliverables:** MkDocs site with tutorials/how-tos, IDE snippets, integration guides, language support roadmap.
- **Exit Criteria:** Pilot team onboarded end-to-end; satisfaction metrics captured; support SLAs defined; docs kept in sync with releases.

### Phase 5 – Operational Hardening & Scale-Up

- **Objectives:** Prepare for production adoption, scale governance, and institute continuous improvement loops.
- **Key Activities:** Establish release cadence, publish SBOM/signing pipeline, instrument telemetry, formalise support processes.
- **Deliverables:** Release checklist, monitoring dashboards, incident response playbook, roadmap for future capabilities.
- **Exit Criteria:** Production readiness review sign-off, operational metrics meeting targets, backlog groomed for next iteration wave.

## Cross-Cutting Practices

- **Risk Management:** Maintain live risk register, mitigation plans, and decision logs; review each sprint.
- **Change Control:** Contract and rules changes require peer review plus automated diff impact analysis; attach evidence to PRs.
- **Security & Compliance:** Continuous dependency scanning, secrets detection, and policy drift checks integrated into pipelines.
- **Documentation:** Update `docs/` alongside features; ensure tutorials reflect latest workflows; generate changelogs per release.
- **Community & Feedback:** Host fortnightly demos, collect developer feedback, refine contract scope, and publish adoption metrics.

## Success Metrics

- Mean time to remediate contract violations ≤ agreed SLA.
- ≥90% automated fix acceptance rate in pilot repos.
- 100% of releases accompanied by SBOM and signed artifacts.
- Onboarding time for new contributors reduced by ≥50% vs baseline.
