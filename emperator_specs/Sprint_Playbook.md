# Emperator Sprint Playbook

## Delivery Cadence Framework

- **Iteration length:** Timeboxed sprints sized to deliver demonstrable value; cadence flexible to team velocity but consistent across workstreams.
- **Planning inputs:** Prioritised backlog, updated risk register, dependency map, and feedback from prior sprint reviews.
- **Definition of Ready:**
  - User stories link to contract changes, IR updates, and automation impacts.
  - Acceptance tests, quality gates, and documentation updates identified.
  - Security/privacy review notes captured where relevant.
- **Definition of Done (per sprint):**
  - All committed stories meet Project Plan quality gates.
  - Contract/Docs updates merged alongside code.
  - Demo recorded or documented for stakeholders.
  - Metrics (coverage, violation counts, adoption feedback) published to dashboard.
- **Quality Checkpoints:** Mid-sprint sync verifies gate status; final day includes full CI run, manual exploratory testing, and risk review.

- **Key Backlog Items:**
      - Implement IR builder service with incremental updates.
      - Configure Semgrep rule packs from contract definitions.
      - Generate CodeQL databases and integrate query execution.
      - Establish data model for correlating findings with contract clauses.
- **Quality Gates:** IR smoke tests passing; Semgrep/CodeQL checks run in CI; performance benchmarks recorded; documentation updated in `docs/reference`.
- **Dependencies:** Access to language grammars and CodeQL licenses; compute resources for analysis.

### Sprint 5 – Automated Fix & Safety Envelope

- **Goals:** Enable deterministic codemod execution with validation safeguards.
- **Key Backlog Items:**
      - Integrate LibCST/OpenRewrite fix engines with dry-run + apply modes.
      - Implement safety gate pipeline (pre/post-checks, rollback on regression).
      - Add property-based or contract-level regression tests for fixes.
      - Produce safety envelope documentation and playbooks.
- **Quality Gates:** Double-run validation logs captured; automated fixes achieve ≥95% success rate in controlled tests; rollback tooling documented.
- **Dependencies:** Mature analysis findings from Sprint 4; contract-defined fix recipes.

### Sprint 6 – Quality & Observability Hardening

- **Goals:** Elevate reliability through monitoring, coverage enforcement, and dependency governance.
- **Key Backlog Items:**
      - Enforce coverage threshold in CI with actionable reporting.
      - Add telemetry for CLI usage, fix outcomes, and contract drift.
      - Integrate dependency scanning, SBOM generation, and signing pipeline.
      - Expand bandit/Semgrep/CodeQL security packs and alerts.
- **Quality Gates:** CI fails on coverage regression; observability dashboard live; security scans produce zero high-severity issues.
- **Dependencies:** Telemetry infrastructure; security tooling accounts.

### Sprint 7 – Developer Experience & Integrations

- **Goals:** Deliver IDE, CI, and onboarding enhancements for smooth adoption.
- **Key Backlog Items:**
      - Build VS Code tasks/extensions and shell completions.
      - Publish GitHub/GitLab integrations with automated comments.
      - Create interactive tutorials and quickstart guides.
      - Collect pilot feedback and refine contract ergonomics.
- **Quality Gates:** Usability testing sign-off; documentation updated; adoption metrics captured; support backlog triaged.
- **Dependencies:** Pilot teams engaged; documentation tooling ready.

### Sprint 8 – Production Readiness & Rollout

- **Goals:** Finalise release processes, support models, and governance for wider deployment.
- **Key Backlog Items:**
      - Define release cadence, semantic versioning, and changelog automation.
      - Finalise support SLAs, escalation paths, and incident response plan.
      - Conduct security/privacy review and sign-off.
      - Plan phased rollout strategy with enablement materials.
- **Quality Gates:** Release checklist executed end-to-end; SBOM and signed artifacts produced; governance board approval obtained; backlog groomed for next cycle.
- **Dependencies:** Completed hardening tasks from prior sprints; stakeholder availability for reviews.

## Continuous Improvement Loop
